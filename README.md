# 🦟 Wild Mosquito Population Controls
This repository contains the code (and the figure) needed to build a MATLAB app useful for developing strategies for controlling a wild mosquito population. The implementation of the dynamical system describing the evolution of mosquitoes is based on the work of Claire Dufourd and Yves Dumont.

## 🧩 Key Features
- Mathematical model for a wild mosquito population dynamics
- Interactive MATLAB app for simulations
- some temperature-dependent parameters for greater model realism



## 💻 Requirements
- MATLAB (reccomended: version 2022b or later)
- App Designer toolbox to edit for editing



## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/LucaZepponi/mosquito_controls.git
    ```
2. Open the .mlapp file in MATLAB
3. Run the app and customize the parameters as needed
